# odin-recipes
This project had four iterations and I committed at the end of every single one.
In the first iteration I created the odin-recipe directory and the index file with html boilerplate and an h1 heading 
In the second one I created the recipes directory and the first recipe lasagna. I used a link to recipe in the index file.
In the third one the html file of the lasagna recipe was modified with an image an unordered list and an ordered one.
In the forth one I add two new recipe and the links to them in the index file in an unordered list.
The images and recipes on this project were taken mostly from giallozafferano.com
